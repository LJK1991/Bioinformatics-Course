The Grade i deserve: 10 of course

made a github account on github name: LJK1991 pass:*************
made a repository that .addignore Bascha files. and has a MIT License
added some files to it, collaberated with roisineeva and added files to here repository.
made an issue at HetRoversNest GitHUB. forked repositorys of lunavdl and quirijnvdijk, added files and changed things. then made a pull request. some got accepted some got denied.
als got some pull request from the same people, denied all.
have not mastered GitHUB yet, but starting to understand it much better. i do get the general idea and the commands and the few error that you can get.

git clone $PATH #get the repository from GitHUB
git pull #update the .git repositiry you are currently in(can acces with cd)
git add --all :/
git commit -m 'message' #commands used to make files ready for uploading to to github
git push #push the new changes to github.
